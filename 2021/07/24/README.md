## Summary

I was working on my blog automation, and did more on the docker-compose files. Today I was working on the ftp uploader for the blog post project. I was working after fixing some issues with the uploader. Now I can see the uploaded files via the console. Next up is finishing the issues I created on github. I'm not ready to publish the blog post project yet on github, since its not fully finished. Will see maybe I can do more with it soon.

I'm looking forward for more of the upcoming week, so excited and pumped.
