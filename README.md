# My Diary

This is a daily (trying to make it daily) collection of my experiences as a developer and life as a student/programmer. I will include most of my thoughts and ideas here with many examples. I basically want to make sure I can show my intentions and thought process on how I present myself. With all the ongoing developer discussions and topics I want to put a small fingerprint of myself on the internet.

If anyone has questions regarding any content, hit me up with a simple issue and ask straight away. I'd appreciate any constructive comments and critiques. That beeing said, I will make sure, to keep this place as safe as possible for me and others.

My "Diary" is not made to joke on things, even tho I love memes. From time to time I might put some sarcasm here and there, and try to clearify the comment as `(sarcasm)`.

Any Ideas on how to make this better? Hit me up on the [issues](https://github.com/oezguerisbert/my-diary/issues) and tell me what you like to see here.
