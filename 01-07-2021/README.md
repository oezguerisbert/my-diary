## Morning

I just started my day at around 11 AM and had my coffee straight away. I booted up my laptop and went to check my emails and news articles. After some hours I had to stretch and get my second coffee. I checked GitHubs copilot AI tool and how well developers actually used it. I realized that most developers love the idea behind it, but not the licensing part and problems surroudned by it. Seems like the AI - which uses OpenAI to find out which code can be used is very untrustworthy. Most code is from open-source code. But Open-Source doesnt mean that it can be used everywhere. Open-Source with given specific licenses will make the whole process very hard. You have to be sure that the code that you use is non-copyrighted or has the given licenses for it.

## Noon

In the noon I continued to work on my backup/restore-functionality of the ||[dotfiles](https://github.com/oezguerisbert/dotfiles.git)|| project (Will publish it next week on monday). So far it works with the current files, but I'd like to make it more dynamic and less complicated for me and others to use. It should be "bad" for now but later it will be made more generic.

## Evening

I was working on the [dotfiles](https://github.com/oezguerisbert/dotfiles.git) project and finshed it up until this version. I will add more stuff to my neovim setup and configurations with certain tools like vim-prettier and ALE. (People recommended me those). I need a proper formatter for every possible language. I also added into my `.zshrc` file a diary functionality for this setup up that I have here. :)
