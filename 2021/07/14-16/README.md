## Short Summary

I was working on my blog-project and was watching mostly naruto shippuden and made music.

I didnt do much the past few days, because I didnt want to fall into a burnout again. Felt many time anxiety pushs and I thought before it gets worse I take action on it. Also my mental health wasnt at the best, more on negative thoughts so I took more time to myself than other things. Tomorrow and sunday will be probably the same, work and relaxing afterwards at home, will see how it goes.
