## Morning

I woke up at 8:30 AM but went to bed again, since I felt like I had a headache. After a few hours I woke up again.

## Afternoon

I woke up again around 1:00 PM and started to work on my laptop with reading news. And watched a stream meanwhile.

Later I continued to work on my dotfiles and the file structure. I removed the backup and restore functionality and added that to the `.zshrc` file. Also I installed the GitHubs CLI tool.

I played some games with my friends and such.

## Night

I also watched some soccer and streams from friends, example given [LongLikeShort](https://twitch.tv/longlikeshort). He does pomodoro based focus times and it helped me to work more productive during the days. Later on we played some games and just started the weekend per usual.
