# 22-23rd July 2021

## Summary

During both of those days I was able to automate the build of the blog project and now I can easily createa production ready webapp. In future I will make the upload of those more efficient and also automated.

Today I also went out and was on a walk, since I don't want to get more of my backpain. The next week will be very exciting, especially on tuesday! :) Will tell about it more after that day, what's up!


PS: Sorry for the lack of daily posts. Needed some time to work on the blog project. And forgot to write here.
