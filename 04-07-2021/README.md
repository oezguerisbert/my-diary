# Sunday 4th July 2021

## Morning
I woke up at 11 AM and started to drink tea right ahead. My goal was it to recover as fast as possible, since I still feel sick from my cold that I caught. 

## Noon & Afternoon

My noon and afternoon I was watching mostly YouTube videos and Twitch streams. I also did drink a bunch of tea and managed to read news on hackernews. 

## Evening & Night

I was talking with some people on discord, watched some Tech videos regarding the new iOS features and read more hackernews. Other than that I did nothing else.

This was so far ok, just not much productive as it should have been.
