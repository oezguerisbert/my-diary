## Summary of the past weeks

I have been working on many different things for the 'ijwtc' project including the blog post project. I realized that in the past I have been not dealing with it properly and made better concept on that behalf. With the correct mindset and execution I managed to make a good use of the new framework I learned about. This framework is called [NestJS](https://nestjs.com) and I ended up with it, somehow either to twitter or [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com). When I was reading through the [Documentation](https://docs.nestjs.com) of it and I liked the phrasing of most of the examples and resources. To be fair tho, after 2 weeks of using the framework I realized that some parts are missing some explainations and/or working quite yet. I was looking to implement an JWT-Strategy for the login and such, but with the actual documentation I didnt manage to fullfill it. The tests that I prepared didnt work. I had to make sure to write a proper way. This lead me to look up YouTube after 5 days of research. I found one video which helped me a ton: [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_L225zpUK0M). After that I managed to make it work smoothly and could also add more features. I'm currently in the state of almost done, but I kinda wanna add more features, or list of things to add. Will see what to do soon.

I'm lately very occupied with applying to jobs and working on this project, to stay productive. So if I don't text any diary entries that's mostly the reason. I hope the reader understands this. If you have any question, ask ahead anytime :)

PS: more to come soon, I hope :)
