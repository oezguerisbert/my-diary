## Morning

I woke up again at 10:30 AM and I helped out some friend. In the meanwhile I was working on my dotfiles to prepare the titles of the corresponding day. I think there is still a bug or misstake, or the localization is set wrong. Will see what I can do about that.

## Afternoon

I managed to render one more tiktok video, that you can see [here](https://tiktok.com/@oetziofficial). 

I came up yesterday with an idea about some blogposts, just like here with my journal/diary. I want to make it more obvious for me to share my journey as a dev, on my personal blog. I didnt want to use 3rd party pages, since I don't know how long they will be there. So I decided to write a little webapp myself. This time I'm going to do a proper one, with better organization and milestones.

## Evening & Night

I was relaxing on a discord and writing this post, while watching [longlikeshort](https://twitch.tv/longlikeshort)'s stream.
