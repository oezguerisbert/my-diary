## Morning

I woke up at 8:30 AM but went to bed again, since I felt like I had a headache. After a few hours I woke up again.

## Afternoon

I woke up again around 1:00 PM and started to work on my laptop with reading news. And watched a stream meanwhile.

Later I continued to work on my dotfiles and the file structure. I removed the backup and restore functionality and added that to the `.zshrc` file. Also I installed the GitHubs CLI tool.
