# 17th-21th July 2021

## Summary

In this week I basically wrote bunch of code that involves the blog project. I also managed to make a docker compose solution for the transpiling of the TypeScript-Code to JavaScript and move to a new folder. 
My next goal is to make a ftp connection to the server and upload the created files and restart the application afterwards. Will see on how todo that.
