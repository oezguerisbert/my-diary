## Update on my current work situation:

So I finally got me an internship place, and in the first week we did make an automation tool, that does look for several PDF files on a folder, confirms the tag-number that was written within the PDF and displays those on the django-admin display.

It was pretty hard, since I was not really prepared to write some python code. On the other side I manage to make the backend work, later on I merged to code with my co-worker (who is also my school friend). After that got merged, we realized that the internet connection was interrupted or aborted randomly. Putting some timeout solved it for a little bit but it was a hacky solution. We would like to make a cron-task, which can solve that issue first. Additionally the Django migrations made me cringe. To be honest I had fun, the django module were difficult to get used to - just like the underlying ORM. Not really my cup of tea yet. Will see how far I can go with it.

## Summary

Looks like django and Python is pretty good, FAST and also reliable. I hope it an work with all the projects I have/like to code with.
