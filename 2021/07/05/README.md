## Morning

I woke up late, and wasn't feeling the best - due to me having a cold. I read the hackernews and saw that the copilot had some issues regarding the commits of secrets of a some repositories. Secrets in a sense of API keys or other credentials, that are needed for the project to be used as. Some of those credentials are still fully working and people realized that this can be abused as a gathering tool, to pre-hijack accounts or other illegal things I wont get into detail here.

## Afternoon

In the afternoon, I was watching more YouTube vides and started preparation to learn about crypto. I want to get into as much detail as possible to understand more about crypto and the impact of it on society and economy. But in order to understand it up to a certain degree, I need to begin with the complete basics and beginning of the development of crypto. Many people just start trading without understanding it, just to make fast money and I feel like that hurts the economy more than helping it. Will see how far this research of mine will go, and I will update here how far I have come on it.

## Evening

In my evening I was watching Twitch streams and had a relaxing time. I didn't want to overwork, during me having a cold.
