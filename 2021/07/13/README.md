## Noon

Today I woke up at 12 AM and got myself a coffee and started my day. I was continuing on the generic way for the `SearchCriteria` from [yesterday](../12/README.md). The goal is kinda important for me so I can make te search algorithm smoother. (For my understanding)
After a while I came up with what is [currently](https://github.com/ev-op/blog/commit/98484036739059cd55d2c1aaa89b11a7075b003d) being used as. I'm still not satisfied with it, since it is not the way I want it to be. Will see what I can do in the next few days.

## Evening

I was working up till 7 PM on the project and was relaxing the evening/night. Later I shortly joined a discord channel and now I'm watching a [streamer](https://twitch.tv/mewtru) talk about memes of the programmer area. Looking on fixing my `SearchCriteria` issue I have.
